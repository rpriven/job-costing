# Job Costing

This repository will have stuff related to job costing, mainly for construction companies.  I am close to finishing an idea I though of yesterday which
calculates the profit and expenses on a job.  It is pretty simple but useful.  I'm trying to figure out the best way to do it for the most concise code 
as far as I know how to do.  This should be uploaded shortly and will be useful for many different companies.  It is written based on my experience in
the roofing industry but could also be useful for a variety of other trades.
